#Â CRUD & SQL Mini Blog

**Create, Read, Update & Delete (aka - CRUD)** are the four basic functions of *persistent storage*. The **CRUD** cycle is crucial for most dynamic web pages, with users and admins enabled to create, browse, edit and delete online records.

Why does CRUD go with **SQL**? CRUD can be applied across many relational database systems. One such system is SQL (Structured Query Language). It is a language used to communicate with modern databases and the commands you need to know, are listed helpfully using CRUD.

### Create

SQL command for create is **INSERT**. This will create new rows in a table.

### Read

SQL command for read is **SELECT**. Use this to ask the databse to show a specific table.

### Update

SQL command for update is **UPDATE**. Can update the tables using this command.

### Delete

SQL command for delete is **DELETE**. Relatively self explanotory!
